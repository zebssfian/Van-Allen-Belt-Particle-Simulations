# Van-Allen-Belt-Particle-Simulations
Numerical simulation of particle motion in the Van Allen Belts, under the influence of the earth's magnetic field. Some pretty animation of the results.

Incentivised by an E&M end-of-semester video project on the topic; the animation style is relatively original and can be reused for other kinds of particle simulation if desired.
