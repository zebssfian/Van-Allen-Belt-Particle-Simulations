# Van-Allen-Belt-Particle-Simulations
Numerical simulations of charged particle motion in the Van Allen Belts under the influence of Earth's magnetic field. Some pretty animations of the results.

Incentivised by an E&M end-of-semester video project on the topic; the animation style is relatively original and can be reused for other kinds of particle simulation if desired.
