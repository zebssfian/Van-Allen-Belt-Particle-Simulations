# Van Allen Belt Particle Simulations

Numerical simulations of charged particle motion in the Van Allen radiation belts under the influence of Earth's magnetic field, with visualizations of the results.

This project was motivated by an E&M video project on the topic, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5COR950k9s).

The animation style is relatively original and can be reused for other kinds of particle simulations if desired.
