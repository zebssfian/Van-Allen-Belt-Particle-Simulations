# Van Allen Belt Particle Simulations

Numerical simulations of charged particle motion in the Van Allen radiation belts under the influence of Earth's magnetic field, with visualizations of the results.

This coding project was motivated by an E&M video project on the topic, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5COR950k9s).

The animation style is inspired by 3Blue1Brown and can be reused for other kinds of particle simulations if desired.

The Earth is modelled as a blue sphere in the center of the picture, and its magnetic field is represented by the blue arrows.
